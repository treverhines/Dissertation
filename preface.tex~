\chapternonum{PREFACE}
This dissertation is the culmination of my research as a doctoral
student in geophysics at the University of Michigan under the
mentorship of Eric Hetland. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 have been published
in Geophysical Research Letters, Geophysical Journal International,
and Journal of Geophysical Research, respectively. Chapters 5 and 6
are currently in review at Journal of Geodesy and Geophysical Journal
International, respectively. Chapter 7 describes the preliminary
results from my most recent project and may be submitted for
publication at a later date.
