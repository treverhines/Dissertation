\section{Abstract}
The estimation of uniform viscosities representing the lower crust and
uppermost mantle from post- or interseismic deformation (i.e.,
apparent viscosities) is inherently biased with respect to a
depth-dependence of the viscosities within each layer. Estimates are
biased toward a more viscous lower crust or a less viscous
lithospheric mantle, depending on the relative geometric mean
viscosities of the two layers. When there is a low viscosity shear
zone beneath the fault, apparent viscosities are close to that of the
shear zone immediately after the earthquake, although the apparent
viscosities increase significantly during the later interseismic
period.  Inferences made from interseismic deformation that the lower
crust is more viscous than the upper mantle may be entirely consistent
with depth-dependent viscosity profiles that have a significant
increase in viscosity from the lowermost crust to the uppermost
mantle.

\section{Introduction}
Numerous studies in tectonically active regions have sought estimates
of the viscosities of the ductile lithosphere, including the lower
crust and uppermost mantle \citep[e.g.,][]{Hetland2003, Pollitz2003,
Pollitz2005, Johnson2007, Hearn2009}. Here we consider estimates of
the ductile lithosphere made by fitting predictions of surface
deformation from mechanical models to geodetic measurements of
interseismic deformation.  Most studies of interseismic deformation
concluded that the lower crust has a higher viscosity than the
uppermost mantle \citep{Burgmann2008, Thatcher2008}. The majority of
mechanical models used in these studies approximated the ductile
lithosphere using two homogeneous viscoelastic layers representing the
lower crust and uppermost mantle \citep[e.g.,][]{Hetland2003,
Pollitz2003, Hearn2009}. These simplistic layered models are commonly
used because they are computationally cheap and because geodetic data
are only capable of resolving a limited number of independent
rheologic parameters \citep[e.g.,][]{Riva2009,Pollitz2010}.  However,
the simplifications made in the layered models may result in inferred
viscosities that are not directly applicable to the real viscosity
structure of the ductile lithosphere \citep{Riva2009}.

Temperatures in the lithosphere increase with depth and viscosity has
a strong temperature dependence \citep[e.g.,][]{Kohlstedt1995}.  The
viscosity of the ductile lithosphere also has a stress-dependence
\citep[e.g.,][]{Kohlstedt1995}, although the ductile lithosphere is
often approximated as Maxwell viscoelastic in these models
\citep[e.g.,][]{Hetland2003, Johnson2007, Riva2009, Yamasaki2012a}.
This may be a reasonable approximation if stresses resulting from
coseismic deformation are small compared to background stresses.  The
Newtonian viscosity inferred in postseismic deformation studies may
not be constant over time and could be interpretted as an effective
viscosity of a power-law creep \citep[e.g.,][]{Freed2006b}. Indeed, to
describe geodetic observations, models of postseismic deformation in
the months to years following an earthquake often require apparent
viscosities up to several orders of magnitude smaller than those
required in models of deformation later in the interseismic period
\citep[e.g.,][]{Pollitz2005,Johnson2007,Meade2013}. It is important to
note that estimates of viscosities from the first few months following
an earthquake may not be directly applicable to the steady viscosities
of the lithosphere, as the immediate transient postseismic deformation
is often considered to be due to postseismic fault creep, poroelastic
rebound, or a transient rheology \citep[e.g.,][]{Pollitz2003,
Freed2006b, Hearn2009}. We save the investigation of models with
non-linear, power-law creep and/or stress driven fault creep to a
subsequent study, and here we only consider stress-linear
viscoelasticity, allowing for a robust depth-dependence of
viscosities.

We address the question of how inferences of single viscosities
representing the entire lower crust and uppermost mantle are related
to depth-dependent viscosities throughout the ductile lithosphere. We
consider inferred viscosities made from rheologically idealized models
of interseismic deformation to be apparent viscosities, and explore
the biases incurred through using simplified models. For brevity, we
use the term ``strength'' to refer to viscosity, or equivalently
Maxwell relaxation time, $\tau_M$ ($\tau_M = \eta/\mu$, where $\eta$
is viscosity and $\mu$ is shear modulus), and thus we use ``strong''
or ``weak'' to refer to high or low viscosities, respectively. We show
that estimates of the lithosphere's strength, based on simplified
layered models, are almost always biased towards a stronger lower
crust or a weaker upper mantle.

\section{Interseismic models}
We create synthetic surface deformation using 2D earthquake cycle
models composed of an infinite length, vertical strike-slip fault in
an elastic layer of thickness $D$ representing the upper crust,
overlying a Maxwell viscoelastic substrate representing the ductile
lithosphere (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:1}). We impose uniform slip on the
fault with repeat time $T$, until the surface deformation reaches a
cycle invariant state (i.e., the model is spun-up). The lower
viscoelastic substrate is composed of a layer of thickness $D$,
representing the lower crust, and a layer of thickness $8D$,
representing the lithospheric mantle. We choose the thickness of the
latter to be large enough such that the specific thickness does not
affect the surface deformation.  Below $10D$, in the asthenosphere, we
assume a homogeneous viscosity of $10^{19}$ Pa$\cdot$sec to the base
of the model domain.  Models of infinite length, vertical strike-slip
faults are anti-symmetric, and we only model one side of the fault. We
use the finite element program GeoFEST \citep{Lyzenga2000} and take
the model domain to be $120D$ wide by $100D$ deep. We impose an
anti-symmetry boundary condition on the model edge containing the
fault, a far-field velocity, $v_T$, on the opposite boundary, chosen
so that there is no net strain accumulation in each earthquake cycle,
and the top and bottom of the model are stress free (the bottom of the
model domain is sufficiently deep that the bottom stress free boundary
condition does not affect the surface deformation).  We consider only
Maxwell viscoelasticity, but include depth-dependent viscosities
within the lower crust and uppermost mantle. We assume that the shear
modulus is uniform throughout the model and that viscosities vary
smoothly, except possibly at $z = 2D$ (i.e., the Moho) and at $z =
10D$ (i.e., base of the lithosphere).  We non-dimensionalize the
spatial dimensions by the fault locking depth, $D$, and time by $T$,
and thus the non-dimensional Maxwell relaxation time is $\tau =
\tau_M/T$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Depth-dependence of $\tau$}
Motivated by the fact that effective viscosity decreases exponentially
with increasing temperature \citep[e.g.,][]{Kohlstedt1995}, we take
$\tau$ to decrease exponentially with depth. For generality, we do not
assume any particular geotherm or composition of the ductile
lithosphere, and instead specify that $\tau$ decreases in each layer
as
\begin{equation}
\tau(z) = \alpha + \beta e^{-\gamma z},
\label{ch1:eq:tau}
\end{equation}
where $z$ is depth within the layer, and $\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$\gamma$ are parameters that vary for each layer. It is possible to
express equation (\ref{ch1:eq:tau}) in terms of the maximum,
$\tau_j^{\max}$, minimum, $\tau_j^{\min}$, and geometric mean,
$\bar{\tau}_j$, relaxation times within layer $j$, where $j$ is ``LC''
or ``UM'' for the lower crust or mantle lithosphere, respectively.  We
consider a wide range of viscosity profiles such that $10^{-1} \leq
\tau_j^{\max} \leq 10^{2}$, $10^{-2} \leq \tau_j^{\min} \leq 10^{1}$,
and $10^{-1} \leq \bar{\tau}_j \leq 10^{1}$, in increments of
$10^{0.5}$.  With these ranges, we consider 5,625 depth-dependent
lithosphere viscosity structures. The relaxation times are
non-dimensionalized by $T$, so for a 100 year recurrence time, the
shortest and longest Maxwell relaxation times we consider are 1 year
and $10^{4}$ years, respectively (corresponding to viscosities of
about $10^{18}$ Pa$\cdot$s and $10^{22}$ Pa$\cdot$s for $\mu \approx
30$ GPa).  Note that we consider profiles where the largest decrease
of $\tau$ can either be in the top or bottom of the layer (Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:1}), and we remark on the impact of this on our results
below.

\section{Determination of apparent strength} 
We define the apparent relaxation times (or equivalently the apparent
viscosities) of the lower crust, $\hat{\tau}_{LC}$, and mantle
lithosphere, $\hat{\tau}_{UM}$, as the relaxation times inferred from
surface interseismic deformation using a model composed of constant
viscosities in the two layers (i.e., a layered model). In general,
$\hat{\tau}_{LC}$ and $\hat{\tau}_{UM}$ have a temporal
\citep{Riva2009} and spatial \citep{Yamasaki2012} dependence.  Both of
which can be thought of as variables of interseismic surface
deformation, given a particular mechanical representation of the
ductile lithosphere, but here we only consider the time dependence of
inferred viscosities.  We denote the interseismic surface velocities
in the models with depth-dependent $\tau$ as $v_{DD}$, and the
velocities in a layered model as $v_{L}$.  We use a grid search to
determine the $\hat{\tau}_j$ in a layered model that produces surface
velocities that closest match the surface velocities in each of the
depth-dependent models. We determine $\hat{\tau}_j$ at 100 evenly
spaced times throughout the interseismic period.  In the grid search,
we search over $10^{-2} \leq \hat{\tau}_j \leq 10^2$, minimizing the
root mean square error (RMSE) between $v_{DD}$ and $v_L$ at $0.5D$
increments of distance from the fault from $0.5D$ to $12D$\@.  We note
that the upper limit of $\hat{\tau}_j$ searched over is a bit
excessive because, for practical purposes, $v_{L}$ is insensitive to
changes in relaxation time for $\tau \gtrsim 10^1$, as the layer is
effectively elastic over interseismic periods \citep{Savage1978}
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A1}). Finally, we assume that the fault slip-rate
and thickness of the lower crust and upper mantle are known.

About halfway through the interseismic period, surface deformation for
almost all models we consider, both layered and depth-dependent, is
indistinguishable from the deformation predicted by an elastic model
with slip rate $v_T$ and locking depth $D$ \citep{Savage1973a} (Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:2}A). Because all models simultaneously predict surface
interseismic velocities similar to the elastic model, $\hat{\tau}_j$
cannot be definitively resolved for a period during the middle of the
earthquake cycle (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:3}C). The exact times within the
earthquake cycle in which the elastic model describes $v_{DD}$ as well
as a layered model, depends on the specific $\tau$ profiles, but it is
during the time period about $.4T$--$.5T$ for most of the models.

overlapping vectors.}
\label{ch1:fig:3} 
\end{figure}

In general, the misfit between $v_{DD}$ and $v_{L}$ is largest early
in the earthquake cycle for models with low $\bar{\tau}_{LC}$ and/or
$\bar{\tau}_{UM}$ (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A2}). The heightened misfit reflects
the fact that there is more postseismic creep in the mid-crust and/or
beneath the Moho in the layered models, resulting in differences in
the wavelength of surface deformation compared to the depth-dependent
models in which $\tau$ is larger in the mid-crust and/or beneath the
Moho.  Misfit decreases to a minimum halfway into the earthquake cycle
when deformation appears elastic.  The misfit increases again late in
the earthquake cycle, although $v_{L}$ is a significantly better match
to $v_{DD}$ compared to immediately after the earthquake.

We illustrate the determination of $\hat{\tau}_j$ using a model with a
depth-dependent $\tau$ profile such that $\bar{\tau}_{LC} =
\bar{\tau}_{UM} = 10^{-0.5}$, $\tau_{LC}^{\max} = \tau_{UM}^{\max} =
10^{0.5}$, and $\tau_{LC}^{\min} = \tau_{UM}^{\min} = 10^{-1}$ (Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:2}). For this particular case, the misfit surfaces in the
grid search shows clear minima and $\hat{\tau}_j$ is a fair
approximation for $\bar{\tau}_j$ early and late in the interseismic
period, although the lower crust relaxation time is slightly
overestimated (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:2}C). About halfway into the cycle,
the layered model that best fits $v_{DD}$ dramatically overestimates
the lower crust relaxation time (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:2}B); however,
there is a large range of $\hat{\tau}_j$ that would sufficiently match
$v_{DD}$ (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:2}C), since during this period the
surface velocities for all models are very close to the velocities for
the elastic model with identical fault slip rate and locking depth
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:2}A). In this particular depth-dependent model,
the velocities throughout the interseismic period are quite similar to
those from elastic models, albeit with different slip rates and
locking depths.

\section{Biases in apparent strength}
One might assume that the apparent $\tau$ estimated using a simple
layered model, $\hat{\tau}_j$, reflects the geometric mean $\tau$ in
those layers, $\bar{\tau}_j$. In general, $\hat{\tau}_j$ estimated
from $v_{DD}$ at any time in one of the depth-dependent models may be
significantly different than $\bar{\tau}_j$.  We consider the
difference between the two values to be an error in the estimation of
$\bar{\tau}_j$ and approximate the bias in the estimation throughout
the interseismic period as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Bias}(\hat{\tau}_j; \bar{\tau}_j) = E[\hat{\tau}_j] - \bar{\tau}_j,
\label{ch1:eq:bias}
\end{equation}
where $E[\hat{\tau}_j]$ is the geometric mean of $\hat{\tau}_j$
estimated from the collection of the depth-dependent models that all
have the same $\bar{\tau}_j$.

$\mathrm{Bias}(\hat{\tau}_j; \bar{\tau}_j)$ represents the bias in the
estimated relaxation times for the lower crust and uppermost mantle
with respect to the geometric mean relaxation time of the two layers.
In the wide range of models we considered, the bias depends on the
contrast between the geometric mean relaxation times in the lower
crust and upper mantle, $\bar{\tau}_{LC} /\bar{\tau}_{UM}$.  Early and
late in the earthquake cycle there is a distinct bias towards an
apparently weak upper mantle when $\bar{\tau}_{LC} / \bar{\tau}_{UM} <
1$ and a bias exaggerating the strength of the lower crust by up to a
few orders of magnitude when $\bar{\tau}_{LC} / \bar{\tau}_{UM} > 1$
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:3}A,C).  About halfway through the interseismic
period, the biases we calculate are not well constrained, but are
generally towards a stronger lower crust and uppermost mantle (Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:3}B). These biases hold when we only consider $\tau$
profiles in which $\tau$ decays with depth faster than log-linearly
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A4}), which indicates the biases are not sensitive to
the specific decay of viscosity with depth provided that there is
still some depth-dependence within both layers.

When we consider models in which the lower crust is homogeneous, and
include a depth-dependent $\tau$ only in the uppermost mantle, there
is no clear bias when $\bar{\tau}_{LC} / \bar{\tau}_{UM} < 1$.
However, when $\bar{\tau}_{LC} / \bar{\tau}_{UM} > 1$, there is a bias
to a stronger lower crust and only a slight bias in the upper mantle
strength (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A3}A,C).  Conversely, when the
uppermost mantle has a uniform relaxation time and $\tau$ is
depth-dependent only in the lower crust, there is no bias when
$\bar{\tau}_{LC} / \bar{\tau}_{UM} > 1$, but when $\bar{\tau}_{LC} /
\bar{\tau}_{UM} < 1$ there is a bias towards a weaker upper mantle,
while the lower crust relaxation time is accurately represented
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A3}D,F). This may be counterintuitive, as one might
think that if the lower crust or mantle was truly homogenous with
respect to its relaxation time, then a simplified layered model should
accurately capture that uniform relaxation time. In the case of both
the lower crust and uppermost mantle being homogeneous, this would be
true. However, if only one layer has a homogeneous relaxation time
which is longer than the mean relaxation time in the depth-dependent
layer, then strength estimates for that layer are biased.  This leads
us to conclude that the biases are created by the depth-dependence of
$\tau$ in the weaker of the two ductile lithospheric layers.

\section{Lower crustal shear zones}
It is likely that highly sheared rocks directly beneath a fault are
considerably weaker than the surrounding lower crust
\citep[e.g.,][]{Montesi2003}, and lower crustal shear zones are well
documented \citep[e.g.,][]{Vauchez2003}. In all of the models that we
present above, the largest $\tau$ in the lower crust is immediately
beneath the fault.  These long relaxation times may suppress the
relaxation of coseismic stresses in the lowermost crust, where the
relaxation times are shorter, and thus may significantly influence our
above conclusion that estimates of lower crustal strength are biased
to stronger values than its geometric mean strength. To investigate
the potential effect of a lower crustal shear zone on the biases in
$\hat{\tau}_j$, we include a $D$ wide vertical shear zone extending
through the lower crust beneath the fault.  We assume that the shear
zone is Maxwell viscoelastic with a constant relaxation time of
$\tau_{SZ} = 10^{-2}$, which is at least an order of magnitude faster
than the surrounding lower crust.

With a weak shear-zone, immediately following an earthquake the
velocities are quite large, and as a result both the lower crust and
uppermost mantle appear uniformly weaker than their geometric mean
strength, with $\hat{\tau}_{LC}$ close to $\tau_{SZ}$ (Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:4}). These heightened postseismic velocities decay
rapidly, although how $\hat{\tau}_{LC}$ or $\hat{\tau}_{UM}$ increases
over time depends on $\bar{\tau}_{LC}/\bar{\tau}_{UM}$. If
$\bar{\tau}_{LC}/\bar{\tau}_{UM} \geq 1$ then $\hat{\tau}_{LC}$ increases
by orders of magnitude, exceeding $\bar{\tau}_{LC}$ (Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:4}B). Otherwise, $\hat{\tau}_{UM}$ rapidly increases
early in the cycle. For all models, $\hat{\tau}_j$ evolves towards a
more reasonable approximation of $\bar{\tau}_j$ late in the cycle
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:4}B). Additionally, the velocities are relatively
steady throughout the later interseismic period compared to a model
without a shear zone but with similar heightened postseismic
velocities (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:4}A).

\section{Discussion}
In the wide range of cases we consider, the biases in $\hat{\tau}_j$
inferred throughout the interseismic period almost always are such
that $\hat{\tau}_{LC}/\hat{\tau}_{UM}$ is larger than
$\bar{\tau}_{LC}/\bar{\tau}_{UM}$, except for midway through the
interseismic period when all velocities are close to the elastic limit
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:3}B).  Additionally, $\hat{\tau}_{LC}$ is often
larger than $\tau^{\max}_{LC}$ and $\hat{\tau}_{UM}$ is often lower
that $\tau^{\min}_{UM}$.  In models where $\bar{\tau}_{LC} \ne
\bar{\tau}_{UM}$, inferences of $\hat{\tau}_{LC}/\hat{\tau}_{UM}>1$
($<1$) correspond to models in which
$\bar{\tau}_{LC}/\bar{\tau}_{UM}>1$ ($<1$). In other words, a lower
crust that appears stronger than the mantle when approximated by
uniform strength layers corresponds to models in which the geometric
mean strength of the lower crust is also stronger than that in the
mantle, and vice versa.  We note that several of the $\tau$ profiles
with $\bar{\tau}_{LC} > \bar{\tau}_{UM}$ are characterized by
significant portions of the lowermost crust having much lower
viscosities than the uppermost mantle.

The biases we present in this paper can be viewed as relating
$\hat{\tau}_j$ to $\bar{\tau}_j$.  However, the specific relationship
between $\hat{\tau}_j$ and $\bar{\tau}_j$ depends not only on the
details of how $\tau$ varies in the ductile lithosphere, but also on
the time in the interseismic period. In the latter regard, it is also
important to note that we have assumed periodic offsets on an infinite
length fault, whereas real earthquakes are non-periodic and finite. It
is also important to note that we grouped all $\tau$ profiles
according to the $\bar{\tau}_j$ in each layer irrespective of
$\tau^{\max}_j$ and $\tau^{\min}_j$, and only considered how profiles
with the same $\bar{\tau}_j$ relate to $\hat{\tau}_j$.  For these
reasons, these biases cannot be used to back-out specific
depth-dependent $\tau$ profiles, or even unique $\bar{\tau}_j$,
consistent with $\hat{\tau}_j$ estimated from geodetic data using a
simplified model of the lithosphere.  The coherency of the bias
estimates suggest that it may be possible to develop probabilistic
relationships between $\hat{\tau}_j$ and $\bar{\tau}_j$, assuming that
the general time within the earthquake cycle the geodetic data are
sampling is known.  For example, if $\hat{\tau}_{LC} \approx 10^{1}$
and $\hat{\tau}_{UM} \approx 10^{-1}$ were inferred from geodetic data
late in a seismic cycle, then those estimates would be equivalent to
depth-dependent $\tau$ profiles with $\bar{\tau}_{LC}$ around
$10^{-0.5}$ to $10^{1}$ and $\bar{\tau}_{UM}$ on order of $10^{-1}$
(Figure \ref{ch1:fig:3}C). Further exploration of the relationships
between specific $\tau$ profiles and $\hat{\tau}_j$ would be required
in order to establish whether inferences of apparent strength could be
used to constrain the range of permissible $\tau$ profiles that are
consistent with surface deformation at any one time.  It may also be
possible to constrain depth-dependent $\tau$ profiles by considering
how inferred viscosities vary as a function of distance from the fault
\citep{Yamasaki2012}.

In the depth-dependent $\tau$ models we consider, the postseismic
velocities are either only slightly above the elastic velocities or
are large but decay over a relatively long portion of the interseismic
period. Both of these cases are in contrast with many observations of
heightened postseismic velocities decaying over on order of a decade
following earthquakes \citep[e.g.,][]{Ergintav2009}. Models including
transient rheologies or power-law creep have been proposed to explain
transient postseismic velocities \citep[e.g.,][]{Pollitz2003,
Freed2006b, Ryder2007}.  Adding a weak shear zone to a model with
depth-dependent $\tau$ and only Maxwell viscoelasticity can also
result in heightened postseismic velocities that rapidly decay over
the postseismic period, while the surface velocities throughout the
majority of the latter interseismic period are only slightly depressed
compared to those in an elastic model with identical slip-rate and
locking depth (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:4}A).

\section{Conclusions}
Assuming a uniform viscosity for the lower crust and uppermost mantle
results in biased estimates of viscosity for those two layers if the
viscosity is highly depth-dependent.  Estimates of viscosity tend to
be biased either towards a weaker upper mantle or a stronger lower
crust, depending on the relative viscosity of the two layers.  When
there is a low viscosity lower crustal shear zone present, immediately
after the earthquake the lower crust and uppermost mantle both appear
weak, with apparent viscosities close to that of the shear zone, and
then the apparent strength of the lower crust or upper mantle
increases dramatically over the early interseismic period.  Using
simplified models, inferences made from interseismic deformation that
the lower crust is orders of magnitude more viscous than the upper
mantle may be entirely consistent with depth-dependent viscosity
profiles that have smaller contrasts between the geometric mean
viscosities of lower crust and upper mantle and may be associated with
a significant increase in viscosity across the Moho.

\section{Supporting information}
The following figures provide additional information supporting our
conclusions regarding the biases in apparent viscosities estimated for
the lower crust and upper mantle. The sensitivity of surface
deformation to viscosities in the lower crust or upper mantle is shown
in Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A1}.  Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A2} is the same as
Figure \ref{ch1:fig:3}, except Figure \ref{ch1:fig:A2} shows all of
the $\hat{\tau}$ for the lower crust and uppermost mantle estimated
from $v_{DD}$ and indicates the misfit for the inferences. Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:A3} shows the bias for end-member scenarios when only the
lower crust or upper mantle has a depth dependent $\tau$. Figure
\ref{ch1:fig:A4} shows the bias when $\tau$ in the lower crust and upper
mantle has a high decay rate (i.e., a decay rate larger than a
log-linear decrease in $\tau$).

considered, along with the estimation of
$\mathrm{Bias}(\hat{\tau}_j)$, represented as vectors, early (A),
midway (B), and late (C) in the interseismic period.  Each vector
points to the mean value of $\hat{\tau}_j$ estimated from depth
dependent models with the same $\bar{\tau}_j$.  Colored dots indicate
$\hat{\tau}_j$ of each of the best fit layered models (dot color
corresponds to the RMSE of how well $v_L$ fits $v_{DD}$).}

[Bias in inferred relaxation times when either the lower crust or
upper mantle is homogeneous]
{$\bar{\tau}_j$ (gray dots) for all depth dependent $\tau$
models with a homogeneous lower crust (A,B,C) or homogeneous upper
mantle (D,E,F), along with the estimation of $\mathrm{Bias}(\hat{\tau}_j)$,
represented as vectors, early (A), midway (B), and late (C) in the
interseismic period.  Each vector points to the mean value of
$\hat{\tau}_j$ estimated from depth dependent models with the same
$\bar{\tau}_j$, and the gray ovals indicate one standard deviation of
$\hat{\tau}_j$ estimated from models with the same $\bar{\tau}_j$.}

[Bias in inferred relaxation times when relaxation times decrease
faster than log-linearly with depth]
{$\bar{\tau}_j$ (gray dots) for all depth dependent $\tau$ models in
which $\tau$ in the lower crust and upper mantle decreases with depth
more than log-linearly (i.e., with $\tau$ at any depth lower than
would be predicted by a log-linear decrease, for instance the left-
most $\tau$ profiles shown in Figure \ref{ch1:fig:1}), along with the
estimation of $\mathrm{Bias}(\hat{\tau}_j)$, represented as vectors,
early (A), midway (B), and late (C) in the interseismic period.  Each
vector points to the mean value of $\hat{\tau}_j$ estimated from depth
dependent models with the same $\bar{\tau}_j$, and the gray ovals
indicate one standard deviation of $\hat{\tau}_j$ estimated from
models with the same $\bar{\tau}_j$.  The estimated biases in these
models are similar to the biases estimated from all depth-dependent
$\tau$ models considered in this paper (Figure \ref{ch1:fig:3}),
indicating that consideration of $\tau$ profiles that decay less than
log-linearly do not drive our conclusions that the lower crust
(uppermost mantle) appear stronger (weaker) than the average $\tau$
during much of the interseismic period.}
