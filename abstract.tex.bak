\chapternonum{ABSTRACT}
Modern day geodetic tools, such Global Navigation  Satellite Systems (GNSS), are able to resolve ground deformation to within millimeter accuracy at daily sampling rates. In the past decade, our ability to resolve tectonic ground deformation in the Western United States has greatly improved due to the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) project, which consists of 1100 continuously operating GNSS stations. With this unprecedented quality and quantity of data, we are able to observed subtle transient ground deformation associated with tectonic processes. For example, we can detect ground deformation in the days to years following large earthquakes, which is caused by aseismic afterslip and/or ductile deformation in the upper mantle. The PBO has also allowed us to resolve transient deformation associated with slow slip events on the Cascadia subduction zone. In this dissertation, I discuss novel methods for detecting transient deformation in GNSS data, and I discuss how this transient deformation can be used to better constrain our understanding of the mechanical behavior of the lithosphere, which can ultimately be used to improve our understanding of seismic hazard.          

Studies on the temporal evolution of ground deformation throughout the earthquake cycle tend to infer that the lower crust is orders of magnitude stronger (more viscous) than the upper mantle. In Chapter 2 I demonstrate that the methods used in these studies are biased towards inferring a more viscous lower crust and less viscous lower mantle. We conclude that these interseismic studies do not necessarily rule out the possibility that the lower crust can deform viscously on earthquake cycle timescales. In Chapters 3 and 4 I introduce a method for discerning the physical mechanisms driving postseismic deformation, where I consider candidate mechanisms to be afterslip and viscous relaxation in the crust and upper mantle. I apply this method to postseismic deformation following the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake in Baja California. I find that a Burgers rheology upper mantle is necessary to describe far-field deformation in the three years following the earthquake. In general, lithospheric viscosities inferred from interseismic deformation are larger than those estimated from postseismic deformation, which occurs over a much shorter timescale. By describing the upper mantle with a Burgers rheology, which contains a transient and steady-state phase of deformation, we are able to reconcile these conflicting studies. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 are on detecting transient geophysical signal in geodetic data. Before geophysical signal can be identified, the noise
in geodetic data must be quantified. In Chapter 5, I point out a bias in commonly used method for characterizing noise in geodetic data, and I propose an alternative unbiased method. In Chapter 6 I demonstrate that transient geophysical signal can be robustly detected by using a machine learning technique known as Gaussian process regression. Finally, in Chapter 7 I assess the utility of borehole strain meters (BSMs) for detecting transient deformation from slow slip events. This is done by comparing BSM data to regional strains derived from GNSS data. I find that it is generally difficult to reconcile BSM data, which records strain over a 8.7 centimeter baseline, with regional strains.
