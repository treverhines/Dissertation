\chapter{Conclusion}
Transient deformation, resulting from either aseismic fault slip or
distributed viscous deformation, offers valuable insight into the
mechanical behavior of the crust and upper mantle. In this dissertation I
provided guidance on detecting and interpreting transient deformation.
In Chapter 2, I assessed the accuracy of existing constraints on the
strength of the lithosphere determined from interseismic deformation.
I have concluded that the methods typically used to infer lithospheric
strength from interseismic deformation are biased towards finding a
more viscous lower crust and a less viscous upper mantle. In Chapter 3,
I introduced a method for discerning the mechanisms driving
postseismic deformation. Chapter 4 is an application of that method to
postseismic deformation following the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake
in Baja California. I found that a Burgers rheology upper mantle is
necessary to describe far-field postseismic deformation. This finding
helps to reconcile a discrepancy between the lithospheric rheology
inferred from postseismic studies and interseismic studies. In
general, studies of interseismic deformation find that the mantle is
significantly stronger than estimates made from postseismic studies.
My inferred Burgers rheology reconciles this discrepancy because I can
explain interseimic deformation with the steady-state viscosity, and
postseismic deformation, which occurs over shorter timescales, can be
explained with the transient viscosity.

Chapters 5, 6, and 7 are generally on detecting geophysical signal in
geodetic data. Before geophysical signal can be identified, the noise
in geodetic data must be quantified. In Chapter 5, I pointed out a
bias in the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method typically used
for quantifying noise in geodetic data. I then demonstrate the
efficacy of the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method as an
unbiased alternative. In Chapter 6 I showed that Gaussian process
regression is a powerful tool for detecting transient geophysical
signal in GNSS data. This method is able to successfully identify
strain from slow slip events, and it provides an unprecedented view of
how that strain evolves over time. These estimates of transient strain
reveal features in the GNSS data that could potentially be used to
constrain our understanding of how faults behave. In Chapter 7 I
analyzed data from borehole strain meters (BSMs) and I found that it
is generally difficult to reconcile BSM data with the regional strains
derived from GNSS data. Of the several dozen BSMs in the Pacific
Northwest, only two stations record strain that is consistent with
GNSS data.

\section{Future work}
\subsection{Revisiting Hines and Hetland 2015}
If postseismic deformation is being driven by viscous relaxation of
coseismic stresses, then it can be used to infer the strength of the
lithosphere. On the other hand, if postseismic deformation is the
result of afterslip, then it can be used to constrain the frictional
properties of faults. The complication is that it is unclear which of
the mechanisms is at play. The geodetic community thus needs a method
for definitively discerning the mechanisms driving postseismic
deformation, and I proposed such a method in Chapter 3. This method,
which I refer to as the \citet{Hines2016} method, is not without its
own complications, and I now elaborate on some areas where the method
can be improved.

The \citet{Hines2016} method is based on an approximation for early
postseismic deformation. This approximation takes a matter of seconds
to evaluate, which makes it tractable to perform the inverse problem,
estimating fault slip and lithospheric viscosity from observable
deformation. However, the approximation requires a precomputed set of
elastic and viscoelastic Green's functions. Evaluating these Green's
functions turns out to be the largest computational burden for the
\citet{Hines2016} method because they must be evaluated numerically
with finite-element software. Not only is it computationally expensive
to perform the finite-element modeling, there is also the laborious
task of meshing. The \citet{Hines2016} method is thus quite
impractical because of its reliance on finite-element modeling.
Recently, \citet{Barbot2017} has derived an analytical solution for
displacements resulting from anelastic deformation in a
three-dimensional half-space. One could conceivably use the solution
from \citet{Barbot2017} to generate the viscoelastic Green's functions
used in the \citet{Hines2016} method. The elastic Green's functions
can be generated with the well known analytical solution form
\citet{Okada1992}. This would completely eliminate the need for
finite-element modeling in the \citet{Hines2016} method.
 
Another complication with the \citet{Hines2016} method is that the
approximation for early postseismic deformation breaks down once
coseismic stresses substantially decay. If the upper mantle has a
viscosity of $10^{18}$ Pa$\cdot$s, which is consistent with the
compilation of estimated upper mantle viscosities from
\citep{Thatcher2008}, then the approximation should break down after
about one year. In Chapter 4, where I apply the \citet{Hines2016}
method to postseismic data following the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake,
I indeed found that the approximation broke down 0.8 years after the
earthquake. Unfortunately, this meant that the remaining 4.2 years
could not be utilized by the \citet{Hines2016} method.  Clearly, the
\citet{Hines2016} needs to be improved so that it is capable of
modeling all the available postseismic data. Perhaps this can be
accomplished with a higher order approximation that is still
numerically efficient to evaluate.

\subsection{Geophysical applications for Gaussian processes}
In Chapter 6, I used Gaussian process regression (GPR) for the purpose
of estimating transient strain from GNSS data; however, I cannot
understate the wide range of additional geophysical problems that GPR
can address. I believe that GPR can be a valuable tool for
assimilating different types of geodetic data. In Chapter 7 I used GPR
to compare GNSS data to data from borehole strain meters (BSMs). While
much of the BSM data contained spurious features, I did note that BSMs
can resolve the timing of geophysical events with greater precision
than the GNSS data. It may then be advantageous to combine GNSS and
BSM data into a single estimate of transient strain. GNSS and BSM data
can be assimilated by recursively performing GPR. Specifically, the
posterior estimate of transient strain derived from GNSS data can be
conditioned again with the BSM data, forming a new posterior
incorporating both datasets.

I also believe that GPR can be a valuable tool for regularizing
inverse problems. One common approach to deal with ill-posed
tomographic inverse problems is to impose smoothness on the solution
\citep{Aster2011}. This is done by assuming that the Laplacian of the
model parameters is close to zero, and there is usually no physical
justification for this assumption. An alternative to Laplacian
smoothing could be to assume a prior Gaussian process for the unknown
model parameters. Since there are a wide range of Gaussian processes
available, the choice of prior can be tailored to be appropriate for
the particular inverse problem. For example, a inversion for coseismic
slip can use a prior Gaussian process which has been constrained so
that stress drops are geophysically reasonable.

In addition to describing geophysical signal, Gaussian processes can
also be used to characterize noise in geodetic data. While I have
focused on characterizing noise in GNSS data in Chapters 5 and 6, the
same analysis could be used to describe the temporal noise in BSM data
and the spatially correlated noise in interferometric synthetic
aperture radar (InSAR) data.
