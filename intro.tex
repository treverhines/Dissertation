	Here is a sample chapter file. The chapters of the thesis
	should be saved to seperate files such as
	\textit{chapter1.tex}. In the file \textit{thesis.tex} the
	\textit{input} command then includes these chapters into the
	thesis. Note that none of the chapter files need any headers.
	This header for each of these files is contained in
	\textit{thesis.tex}. The file \textit{thesis.tex} also
	includes the numbers system for the sections, figures,
	theorems lemmas etc...

\section{Sample Section}
\label{sample_section}

	This is what a sample section looks like. Let's conclude this
	section with a sample theorem statement and proof.

	\begin{theorem}
	\label{sample_theorem}
	The are an infinite number of prime numbers
	\end{theorem}

	\emph{Proof:} On the contrary assume there are a finite number
	of primes $P_1, P_2, ... P_n$. Consider $\mathcal{P} = P_1 P_2
	\cdots P_n+1$. $\mathcal{P}$ is not divisible by any of the
	primes in our finite set. (Contradiction) $\square$
