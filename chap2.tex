	The following is an example of using the commands \textit{ref}
	and \textit{label}. With these commands theorems, chapters,
	sections and figurres can be labeld with names in the tex file
	and then refered to by these names in later tex files. In
	chapter~\ref{intro} we saw section~\ref{sample_section} or
	theorem~\ref{sample_theorem}.

	Lastly, here is how to include a figure. First generate an
	encapsulated postscript file in xfig, adobe illustrator or
	some other program. The specific commands are found in
	\textit{chap2.tex}.

        \begin{figure}[htb]
        \centerline{ \epsfig{figure=sample.eps, 
        height =  1.5 in}}
        \caption{Sample Figure}
        \label{sample_figure}
        \end{figure}
