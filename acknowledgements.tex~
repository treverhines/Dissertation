\chapternonum{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Eric Hetland. I am very grateful
to him for giving me this opportunity. He has provided me with
guidance and has been supportive of all of my tangential scientific
inquiries. I am also very thankful to the rest of my dissertation
committee for their valuable feedback that improved this dissertation.

I would also like to thank my fellow geophysics graduate students at
the University of Michigan. Much of this dissertation has been
inspired by our discussions on both the technical and theoretical
aspects of geophysics.

I must also acknowledge the countless scientists, engineers, and
hobbyists making up the open source software community. My research
would not have been possible without their generous work. In
particular, I would like to thank members of the Computational
Infrastructure for Geodynamics for maintaining the geophysical
modeling software used in my research.

The research presented in this dissertation was funded by NSF grants
EAR 1045372 and 1245263. The geodetic data used in this research is
provided by UNAVCO through the GAGE Facility with support from the
National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) under NSF Cooperative Agreement EAR 1261833.
